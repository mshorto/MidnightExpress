<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>Q: I still don't get it. What exactly is Midnight Express?</h2>
<h3>A: Midnight Express is like getting together with a group of your friends, pooling your money and renting a charter bus to bring you home. Except instead of your friends it's people you've never met, we pool your money through the crowdfunding site <a href="www.tilt.com" target="_blank">Tilt</a> and you never have to speak to a bus company. All you have to do is make the minimum dontation ($15) and show up at the pick up location on time.</h3>

<h2>Q: What is <a href="www.tilt.com" target="_blank">Tilt</a> and how does it work?</h2>
<h3><a href="www.tilt.com/learn" target="_blank">Tilt</a> is a crowdfunding site similar to <a href="www.kickstarter.com" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. It is a way to collect money from a group to make something happen. With Tilt, there's zero risk to supporters because nobody's card is charged until the minimum goal (or "tilt") is reached. If a bus does not reach it's "tilt" by 12 hours prior to the time it is supposed to depart, no one will be charged and that bus will not run.</h3> 

<h2>Q: How will I know if a bus has "tilted" or not?</h2>
<h3>A: Once a bus hits it's "tilt" amount, we will email all who have donated to let them know the bus is running. If a bus does not "tilt" in time, we will email all who have donated 12 hours prior to departure to inform them the bus will not be running. 

<h2>Q: Can I make a donation on the night-of right at the bus and still get a seat?</h2>
<h3>A: If we still have seats available, we will be allowing people to join the bus at the door during boarding. But it is best to make your donation ahead of time to make sure the bus hits it's minimum donation amount.</h3>

<h2>Q: Can I be dropped off somewhere other than the locations listed?</h2>
<h3>A: You can only be dropped off at the locations listed on the route your bus is scheduled to go. Message (reservations@midnightexpress.io) or tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/Ride_MidnightSF" target="_blank">@Ride_MidnightSF</a> and let us know what cities, times, or routes you would like to see added.</h3>

<h2>Q: What do I need to bring with me in order to get on the bus?</h2>
